Installation
------------

See redmine plugin installation howto. The current +master+ branch targets Redmine +2.3.x+.

This fork does not use Python asciidoc command, but uses asciidoctor.

Documentation
-------------

The formattter supports all asciidoc standard syntaxes.

It is possible to generate a ToC by adding +:toc:+ in the wiki page.

Known Limitations
-----------------

The ToC is sometimes not generated (no root cause identified).
