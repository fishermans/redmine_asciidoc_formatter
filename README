# Redmine Asciidoc Formatter

## Installation

See redmine plugin installation howto.

This plugin requires asciidoc (sudo apt-get install asciidoc).

You should also install pygments (sudo apt-get install python-pygments) and 
source-highlight (sudo apt-get install source-highlight).

## Documentation

The formattter supports all asciidoc standard syntaxes. It supports also Redmine macros
( `{{Macro()}}`, automatic links (#<ID>, source:<path/to/file>, commit:<ref>...) and also a
new syntax for wiki links:
 wiki:<WikiPageName> where <WikiPageName> is the name of the linked wiki page.

## Known Limitations

The inclusion of the ToC is automatic but that causes a issue; the ToC is included 
everywhere, even for issue descriptions and project summaries.

The ToC is sometimes not generated (no root cause identified).

## Notes

This plugin was derived directly from:
  * redmine_restructuredtext_formatter (http://github.com/alphabetum/redmine_restructuredtext_formatter.git)
  * RbSt (http://rdoc.info/github/alphabetum/rbst)
